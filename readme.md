followed a guide and i cant use this without it being public so..

button style is tutorial from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_link_advanced)

this works using js dos in kiosk mode and full screen feel free to take my stuff idc

also since the time i am writing this i have ripped the file for gta off of dos zone because i could not  host my own gta because it was over 25mb but its all the same files
